          <h2>Battery Passport</h2>
          <p>
            The Battery Passport is a digital identity that ensures full
            traceability of a battery from raw material sourcing to end-of-life
            recycling. It securely records both static and dynamic data
            throughout the batteryâ€™s lifecycle, enhancing transparency,
            compliance, and sustainability in the supply chain. In the upstream
            phase, key entities such as miners, cell manufacturers,
            distributors, retailers, and Tier-1 pack manufacturers collect
            crucial data, including material sourcing, manufacturing processes,
            quality control details, and shipment records.
            <br /> <br />
            This data is converted into verifiable credentials (VCs) using
            Hyperledger Indy, ensuring immutability and tamper-proof
            authentication. The credentials are then issued by Tier-1
            manufacturers and securely stored by the OEMs (Original Equipment
            Manufacturers) for verification and supply chain tracking. In the
            downstream phase, real-time dynamic data such as battery discharge
            rate, charge cycles, usage patterns, and temperature metrics is
            collected by OEMs, dealers, recyclers, and regulatory bodies. This
            data is managed on Hyperledger Fabric, ensuring secure and
            permissioned access. <br />
            <br />
            Additionally, IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is used for
            decentralized storage, enabling scalability and efficient data
            retrieval. By integrating blockchain technology, the Battery
            Passport enhances security, prevents counterfeiting, and promotes a
            circular economy, ensuring that batteries are sustainably tracked
            and efficiently recycled at the end of their lifecycle. This digital
            identity ensures <strong>full traceability</strong> from raw
            material sourcing to end-of-life recycling. Using{" "}
            <strong>Hyperledger Indy</strong>, we create{" "}
            <strong>verifiable credentials</strong> that securely store
            information about the battery's components, manufacturing processes,
            quality control data, and shipment details.
